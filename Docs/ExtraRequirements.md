## Business Requirements

Our custoer, George P. Burdell, asked us to design a simple, single-player word game for him. In order to fullfill this business requirements, our desgin and final product will build to his satisfaction. We need to actively communicate with George as each of our deliverables come out. Answer his questions and add, delete or modify our plan and process according to his feedback.

## User Requirements

We need to know: 
1) What type of cellphone with what version of Android system George have.
2) If George would like to update his Android system in the future, we need to provide the game that is compatible to the new system.
3) Detailed preference from George. For exmaple, what user interface he like, what color/size/shape he prefer for buttons and texts. What is the best way to present the data (if he would like a popup window or new interface). 

## Functional Requriements

All functional requriements are already provided by instructor. We want to make sure that our app follow these requirements. We will have a test plan and enough test cases to prove it.

## Non-Functional Requirements

We would like to maintain a good level of usability, performance and efficiency. Both usability and performance ties back to George's feedback. Efficiency would be related to how much coding we have and how much time we contribute to this project.
